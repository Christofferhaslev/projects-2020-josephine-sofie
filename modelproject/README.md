# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Overlapping Generations Model**. In the project we investigate capital accumulation in the OLG-model for different levels of risk aversion and capital accumulation when a pay-as-you-go social secureity system is introduced to the model. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
