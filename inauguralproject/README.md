# Inaugural project
In this project we have solved the consumer problem of maximazing the utility, such that the consumer chooses the optimal level of consumption c* and the optimal level of labor supply, l* given the wage rate and parameters. This is done by using a solver. 
Furthermore, we have calculated the total tax revenue, when every consumer in a population of N = 10.000 individuals maximize utility given that the distribution of the wages is uniform, such that w~U(0.5,1.5). Also we see what happens with the total tax revenue, when the Frisch elasticity of labor supply changes from ε=0.3 to ε=0.1.  
Finally, we solve the polician's problem of choosing the optimal tax rates and the optimal cut-off for the top labor income bracket, such that the tax revenue is maximized. This is done by using a loop.
