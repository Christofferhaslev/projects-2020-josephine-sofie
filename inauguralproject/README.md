# Inaugural project
 In this project we have solved the consumer problem of maximazing the utility, such that the consumer chooses the optimal level of consumption c* and the optimal level of labor supply, l* given the wage rate and parameters. This is done by using a solver. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [inauguralproject.ipynb](inauguralproject.ipynb).
