# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Education in Denmark 2008-2019** and is about the development in education level in Denmark. In the project, we examine the development in education level by ancestry and the development in Upper Secondary education by gender.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

This **loades two datasets**:

1. HFUDD10 from Danmarks Statistik statistikbanken/HFUDD10
1. FOLK1C downloaded from Danmarks Statistik statistikbanken.dk/FOLK1C

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install ipywidgets``
``pip install git+https://github.com/elben10/pydst``
